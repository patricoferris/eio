(** [of_unix ~sw ~blocking ~close_unix fd] wraps [fd].

    @param sw Close [fd] automatically when [sw] is finished.
    @param blocking Indicates whether [fd] is in blocking mode.
                    Normally you should call [Unix.set_nonblock fd] first and pass [false] here.
    @param close_unix Whether {!close} also closes [fd] (this should normally be [true]). *)

(** [use_exn op t fn] calls [fn wrapped_fd], ensuring that [wrapped_fd] will not be closed
    before [fn] returns.

    If [t] is already closed, it raises an exception, using [op] as the name of the failing operation. *)

val close : t -> unit
(** [close t] marks [t] as closed, so that {!use_exn} can no longer be used to start new operations.

    The wrapped FD will be closed once all current users of the FD have finished (unless [close_unix = false]).
