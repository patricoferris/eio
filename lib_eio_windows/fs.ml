(* This module provides (optional) sandboxing, allowing operations to be restricted to a subtree.

   For now, sandboxed directories use realpath and [O_NOFOLLOW], which is probably quite slow,
   and requires duplicating a load of path lookup logic from the kernel.
   It might be better to hold a directory FD rather than a path.
   On FreeBSD we could use O_RESOLVE_BENEATH and let the OS handle everything for us.
   On other systems we would have to resolve one path component at a time. *)

      For unrestricted access, this just runs [fn None path].
      For sandboxes, it opens the parent of [path] as [dir_fd] and runs [fn (Some dir_fd) (basename path)]. *)
